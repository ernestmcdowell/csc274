## Question 1
>Ping the following servers.  Observe the time it takes for the ping to make the round trip.  Use a command to ping 10 times and report the statistics (in other words, don't hit the Control-C to stop it).  In the summary statistics it should show the minimum, average (avg) and maximum times.  Based on the ping times only, list the systems from fastest to slowest.   Now realistically consider where those servers are geographically.   Do the times make sense?
* www.serversaustralia.com.auLinks to an external site. -- Um.   I think that is in Australia.  But I am kind of guessing.
* www.virtbiz.comLinks to an external site. -- This is in Dallas, Texas.  If you watch the GTOger channel on youtube where they tow the cars, this server is in the building of the parking lot
* evan.cs.missouriwestern.edu -- It should be REALLY close.  

>>## Answer Question 1
1. even.cs.missouriwestern.edu : **AVG Ping: 0.297**
2. www.serversaustralia.com.au  **AVG Ping - 14.882ms**
3. www.virtbiz.com : **AVG Ping - 29.527ms**

## Question 2
>Traceroute to the above locations.  Does that tend to confirm or refute your assessment in question 1 about which one is the farthest away? Explain your answer.
>>## Answer Question 2
1. evan.cs.missouriwestern.edu : **1 routes**
2. www.serversaustralia.com.au : **13 routes**
3. www.virtbiz.com : **20 routes**  
* I was surprised that the server located in Dalas took more routes and time to reach than the one in Australia. I would have figured it would have been the other way around. **virtbiz** taking less time and less routes than **serversaustralia**.

## Question 3
>Use the ip command to find the addresses on woz.  Based on the output, how many physical network cards does woz have?  How many appear to be in actual use?  (Hints: They are probably a physical card if they have a MAC or interface address that is not zero.  They probably are plugged and in use if they have an IPv4 address that is not zero.)  
>>## Answer Question 3  
1. There appear to be 3 network cards installed : **lo**, **eno1**, and **eno2**
2. There appear to be 2 in use : **lo** and **eno1**

## Question 4
>The ipv4 address of of evan.cs.missouriwestern.edu, woz.cs.missouriwester.edu, webservices.missouriwestern.edu, and www.missouriwestern.eduLinks to an external site. all have something in common.  What do all of the IPv4 addresses have in common besides being IPv4 addresses?  
>>## Answer Question 4
* They all begine with the **10.**. prefix.


## Question 5
>Go to Project Gutenburg at https://www.gutenberg.org/Links to an external site..  Pick a book.  Get the URL of the book's text file.  Use wget to fetch the book back to your home directory on woz.  Then use sftp to move the book to your laptop or home computer.  Now use ftp to move it to webservices.missouriwestern.edu.  Include a screenshot or video to show that the file is in both locations.  (Oops;  The notes and handouts say to use "push."  The command is really "put")  
>> ## Answer Question 5  
* **See attached screenshot**
